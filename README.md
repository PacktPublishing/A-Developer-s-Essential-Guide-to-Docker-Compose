**Simplify the development and orchestration of multi-container applications**

## What is this book about?
Software development is becoming increasingly complex due to the various software components used. Applications need to be packaged with software components to facilitate their operations, making it complicated to run them. With Docker Compose, a single command can set up your application and the needed dependencies.
This book starts with an overview of Docker Compose and its usage and then shows how to create an application. You will also get to grips with the fundamentals of Docker volumes and network, along with Compose commands, their purpose, and use cases.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Create multi-container applications using Docker Compose
* Use Docker Compose for daily development
* Connect microservices leveraging Docker network fundamentals
* Add monitoring to services leveraging Prometheus
* Deploy to production using Docker Compose
* Translate Compose files to Kubernetes deployments

$ docker compose logs
$ docker compose logs -f
$ docker compose logs -f --timestamps --tail="3" --no-color
$ docker compose top
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for software engineers, developer advocates, and DevOps engineers looking to set up multi-container Docker applications using Compose without the need to set up a Docker orchestration engine. It is also for team leads looking to increase the productivity of an organization’s software teams by streamlining the provisioning of complex development environments locally using Docker Compose. Readers are expected to understand containerization and must possess fundamental Docker knowledge to get started with this book.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-13).
